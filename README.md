# 2D Momentum Solver
## Synopsis:
The 2D Momentum Solver is a Java GUI application built using the Netbeans IDE. This program is a GUI port of the C++ program [2D Momentum Computation System](https://github.com/kgorgi/2D-MCS). The 2D Momentum Solver solves complex two dimensional conservation of momentum problems. Problems that can be solved using this program include two object collisions with the unknown momentum vector before or after the collision. These two objects can also fuse together after the collision to produce a single moving mass.

## Motivation:
The main motivation behind this project is to develop a complex Java GUI application using an integrated development environment. Additionally, another purpose of this project to is gain experience porting code from one programming language (C++) to another programming language (Java).

##Installation:
2D Momentum Solver is supported on a variety of systems. To use 2D Momentum SOlver with Mac OS X please download and unzip the "2D_Momentum_Solver_for_Mac.zip" file. To use  with Windows please download and run the "2D_Momentum_Solver_for_Windows.exe" file. For all other operating systems that support Java 8 SE Runtime Environment, download and run the "2D_Momentum_Solver.jar" file. (Note: All file downloads above can be found in the releases tab of this github project)
